To run an executable as a service that prints its output to the screen during boot up in Linux, you can create a systemd service unit. Here are the general steps to do this:

1. Create a systemd service unit file:
   Open a text editor with superuser privileges (e.g., `sudo nano`, `sudo vim`, or `sudo gedit`) and create a new service unit file in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. For example:

   ```shell
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/my_service.service
   ```

2. Add the following content to the service unit file:
   Replace `my_service` with a name for your service, and adjust the `ExecStart` line to point to the location of your executable.

   ```plaintext
   [Unit]
   Description=My Custom Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/path/to/your/executable
   StandardOutput=tty
   TTYPath=/dev/console
   Restart=always

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Reload the systemd configuration:
   Run the following command to reload systemd's configuration and enable your service to start on boot:

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable my_service.service
   ```

5. Start the service:
   You can start the service immediately with:

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl start my_service.service
   ```

Now, your service should run during boot up, and its output will be printed to the screen. You can view the output by switching to the appropriate TTY (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+F1 for the first virtual console).

Please make sure to replace `/path/to/your/executable` with the actual path to your executable and customize other service settings as needed.
